- The first layer replicates edge network containing different IoT devices, connected via internet. The user interface enhance visualization among IoT devices.
- Second layer facilitates in connection between layer 1 and layer 3, by providing data transport.
- Third layer consist of blockchain, which provides security, immutability, and privacy via decentralized data storage.

- For layer 1, EdgeX Foundary , an open source IoT edge computing platform is used.
- For layer 2, Microservices & Apache Kafka is used.
- For layer 3, Hyperledger Blockchain network is used.
