# Blockchain-Based Edge Computing IoT Architecture
The blockchain based edge computing architecture consist of three layers given as : IoT representation layer, Middleware, and blockchain.

## A three-layer annotated architecture :

- The first layer replicates edge network containing different IoT devices, connected via internet. The user interface enhance visualization among IoT devices.
- Second layer facilitates in connection between layer 1 and layer 3, by providing data transport.
- Third layer consist of blockchain, which provides security, immutability, and privacy via decentralized data storage.

## Proposed overall architecture :

- For layer 1, EdgeX Foundary , an open source IoT edge computing platform is used.
- For layer 2, Microservices & Apache Kafka is used.
- For layer 3, Hyperledger Blockchain network is used.

## Guide Through:
- To set up layer 1 follow : [EdgeX Foundary](https://github.com/bushra2001/Blockchain-Based-Edge-Computing-IoT-System/blob/main/layer1.md)
- To set up layer 2 follow : [4 Microservices along with Apache Kafka](https://github.com/bushra2001/Blockchain-Based-Edge-Computing-IoT-System/blob/main/layer2.md)
